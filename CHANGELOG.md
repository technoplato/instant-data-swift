## July 27th, 2026 at 9:45:23 a.m. EDT — `d3e6e704121d` Add dependency-controlled Instant IDs

- **Implementation commit:** `d3e6e704121d0c4c4431a7b346a6c1d49f6e5312`
- **Change:** Generate typed entity IDs through the Point-Free UUID dependency
- **Details:**
  - Add `InstantID<Entity>()` with canonical lowercase UUID formatting for concise new-entity creation.
  - Preserve `init(rawValue:)` for server, imported, and domain-defined IDs and document the module boundary in ADR 0002.
- **Files:**
  - `Sources/InstantSwiftData/InstantTypedAPI.swift` — Add the dependency-controlled initializer without coupling the core module to Dependencies.
  - `Tests/InstantSwiftDataTests/TypedAPITests.swift` — Prove a UUID override deterministically controls the generated typed ID.
  - `docs/adr/0002-dependency-controlled-instant-ids.md` — Record before/after usage, reasoning, and consequences.
- **User context (verbatim):**
  > Add dependency-controlled IDs ... without broadening the application/library sync boundary.
- **SpecStory:** unavailable — Codex desktop sessions are not supported by the documented SpecStory CLI capture workflow, so no durable session URI is available.

## July 27th, 2026 at 9:30:14 a.m. EDT — `0bda5d56651a` Isolate malformed outbox mutations

- **Implementation commit:** `0bda5d56651ac8e1b5e107b7a5a74ccc4f6c7a68`
- **Change:** Fail only an unencodable live mutation and continue sending later healthy mutations
- **Details:**
  - Separate attribute-resolution failures from socket-send failures inside the live session.
  - Persist local encoding failures without marking the shared connection errored or aborting the delivery loop.
- **Files:**
  - `Sources/InstantSwiftDataCore/InstantRuntime.swift` — Collect and durably isolate per-mutation encoding failures.
  - `Tests/InstantSwiftDataCoreTests/InstantLiveTransportTests.swift` — Prove a malformed first mutation cannot poison the healthy mutation behind it.
- **User context (verbatim):**
  > One mutation with an unresolvable attribute aborts the delivery loop and can poison every reconnect.
- **SpecStory:** unavailable — Codex desktop sessions are not supported by the documented SpecStory CLI capture workflow, so no durable session URI is available.

## July 27th, 2026 at 9:30:14 a.m. EDT — `ea1ca27e3cd0` Preserve same-millisecond outbox order

- **Implementation commit:** `ea1ca27e3cd0be0414ea328ef9e1ab1e10f7278d`
- **Change:** Preserve insertion order for default-timestamp mutations created in the same millisecond
- **Details:**
  - Advance implicit mutation timestamps above the newest durable outbox timestamp, including after compare-and-swap retries.
  - Keep explicitly supplied domain timestamps unchanged so deliberate older writes retain their ordering semantics.
- **Files:**
  - `Sources/InstantSwiftDataCore/InstantRuntime.swift` — Assign monotonic implicit outbox timestamps.
  - `Tests/InstantSwiftDataCoreTests/InstantLiveTransportTests.swift` — Prove reverse-lexical transaction IDs retain insertion order across relaunch.
- **User context (verbatim):**
  > Pending mutations created in the same millisecond are tie-broken by random UUID, so replay/rebase order can invert.
- **SpecStory:** unavailable — Codex desktop sessions are not supported by the documented SpecStory CLI capture workflow, so no durable session URI is available.

## July 27th, 2026 at 9:12:06 a.m. EDT — `ac10cb376523` Reference-count live room joins

- **Implementation commit:** `ac10cb37652315a4d81d488de1848ebd2cc8af9d`
- **Change:** Keep shared Reactor rooms joined until their final observer leaves
- **Details:**
  - Count local observers for each room registration instead of treating every leave as final.
  - Send `leave-room` only when the last local observer departs, preserving the shared subscription for remaining observers.
- **Files:**
  - `Sources/InstantSwiftDataCore/InstantReactorParity.swift` — Track room observer counts and remove registrations only at zero.
  - `Tests/InstantSwiftDataCoreTests/InstantReactorParityTests.swift` — Prove that duplicate joins require matching leaves before a server leave is sent.
- **User context (verbatim):**
  > maintain a human-readable timestamped commit audit journal and clean worktrees
- **SpecStory:** unavailable — Codex desktop sessions are not supported by the documented SpecStory CLI capture workflow, so no durable session URI is available.

## July 27th, 2026 at 9:09:40 a.m. EDT — `2739e7e52982` Isolate automatic fetch generations

- **Implementation commit:** `2739e7e5298215af04768d2b2ddcf6c1f0340b62`
- **Change:** Prevent automatic fetch observation from superseding explicit tasks
- **Details:**
  - Reserve a generation for automatic observation and require that generation when installing its subscription.
  - Stop a canceled or stale automatic observer from invalidating a newer projected-value task with CancellationError.
- **Files:**
  - `Sources/InstantSwiftData/InstantSwiftData.swift` — Make automatic FetchStorage subscription installation generation-aware.
- **User context (verbatim):**

## July 27th, 2026 at 9:09:40 a.m. EDT — `aab5dec69a27` Stabilize ordering parity fixtures

- **Implementation commit:** `aab5dec69a27493df3df5b8b54ed5c417405f0f5`
- **Change:** Make ordering parity fixtures model genuinely later edits
- **Details:**
  - Give the infinite-query reorder mutation an explicit timestamp beyond the fixture hash range and assert the complete local ordering before checking the visible window.
  - Move the Reminders list with a timestamp newer than every seeded list triple.
- **Files:**
  - `Tests/InstantSwiftDataCoreTests/InstantInfiniteQueryParityTests.swift` — Stabilize and tighten the out-of-window reorder fixture.
  - `Tests/InstantSwiftDataCoreTests/InstantSharingSourceParityTests.swift` — Use a later timestamp for the move parity fixture.

## July 27th, 2026 at 9:09:40 a.m. EDT — `cabc4677fbb4` Fix optimistic mutation rebasing

- **Implementation commit:** `cabc4677fbb4f81741669d919c818b9d86762fd7`
- **Change:** Keep later optimistic mutations visible over server refreshes
- **Details:**
  - Rebase each remaining optimistic mutation with a timestamp newer than the authoritative server snapshot, matching upstream Reactor overlay semantics.
  - Document the immutable startup trace Sendable boundary required by the concurrency guidance suite.
- **Files:**
  - `Sources/InstantSwiftDataCore/InstantRuntime.swift` — Restamp rebased local writes above the current server snapshot.
  - `Sources/InstantSwiftDataCore/InstantStartupTrace.swift` — Document the unchecked Sendable safety mechanism.

## July 27th, 2026 at 9:09:40 a.m. EDT — `6a185835b571` Adopt intent changelog workflow

- **Implementation commit:** `6a185835b57162af967880f93ea8731f7ad20242`
- **Change:** Adopt the repository intent-ledger workflow
- **Details:**
  - Add the change-log discipline to repository instructions and establish a newest-first human-readable ledger.
  - Install the reusable ledger recorder and reproducible-build provenance helper for subsequent implementation commits.
- **Files:**
  - `AGENTS.md` — Require small implementation commits, separate ledger commits, and reproducible provenance.
  - `CHANGELOG.md` — Establish the repository-local intent ledger.
  - `scripts/change-log/record_change.py` — Add deterministic ledger entry generation.
  - `scripts/change-log/build_provenance.py` — Add clean-build provenance generation.

## July 27th, 2026 at 8:55:43 a.m. EDT — `d7dd19d499ce` Fix live query error isolation

- **Implementation commit:** `d7dd19d499ce8bf3643c5cbb2967fab7746963ed`
- **Change:** Isolate rejected live queries and prevent stale manual-delivery sends
- **Details:**
  - Preserve the server original-event so add-query failures retire only the rejected registration, fail queryOnce promptly, and leave the shared socket opened for healthy queries.
  - Honor autoConnectLiveTransport before scheduling background mutation delivery so a confirmed mutation captured while disconnected cannot be sent after a later manual connect.
- **Files:**
  - `Sources/InstantSwiftDataCore/InstantLiveTransport.swift` — Decode and retain the server original-event on live errors.
  - `Sources/InstantSwiftDataCore/InstantRuntime.swift` — Route query rejection outcomes without reconnecting and gate automatic mutation delivery.
  - `Tests/InstantSwiftDataCoreTests/InstantReactorParityTests.swift` — Prove healthy-query isolation, prompt one-shot failure, and durable pending-mutation behavior.
- **User context (verbatim):**
  > maintain a human-readable timestamped commit audit journal and clean worktrees
