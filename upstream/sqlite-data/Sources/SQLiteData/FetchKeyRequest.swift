/// struct PlayersRequest: FetchKeyRequest {
///   struct Value {
///     let injuredPlayerCount: Int
///     let players: [Player]
///   }
///
///   func fetch(_ db: Database) throws -> Value {

///       injuredPlayerCount: Player

/// `@Observable` model, UIKit view controller, and more:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct PlayersView: View {
///   @Fetch(PlayersRequest()) var response
///
///   var body: some View {
